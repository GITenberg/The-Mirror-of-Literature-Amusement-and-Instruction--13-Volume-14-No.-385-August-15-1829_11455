<h2>HAMPTON COURT.</h2>

<div class="figure" style="width:100%;"><a href=
"images/385-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/385-1.png" alt=
"Hampton Court." /></a></div>

<p>Here is a bird's-eye view of a royal palace and domain "cut out
in little stars." It is copied from one of Kipp's Views in Great
Britain in the time of Queen Anne, and affords a correct idea of
Hampton Court in all its olden splendour.</p>

<p>The palace is situated on the north bank of the Thames, two
miles west from Kingston. It was magnificently built by Cardinal
Wolsey. After he became possessed of the lease of the manor of
Hampton, "he bestowed," says Stow, "great cost of building upon it,
converting the mansion-house into so stately a palace, that it is
said to have excited much envy; to avoid which, in the year 1526,
he gave it to the king, who in recompense thereof licensed him to
lie in his manor of Richmond at his pleasure; and so he lay there
at certain times;" but it appears that Wolsey after this
occasionally inhabited the palace (perhaps as keeper;) for in 1527,
when some French ambassadors were in England, the king sent them to
be entertained by the Cardinal at Hampton Court. The preparations
for this purpose are detailed in a MS. copy of Cavendish's <i>Life
of Wolsey</i>, in the British Museum, and afford the reader some
idea of the magnificent taste of the prelate in matters of state
and show. The Cardinal was commanded to receive the ambassadors
with surpassing splendour; then "my Lord Cardinal sent me (Mr.
Cavendish) being his gentleman usher, with two other of my fellows
thither, to foresee all things touching our rooms to be nobly
garnished"&mdash;"accordingly our pains were not small nor light,
but daily travelling up and down from chamber to chamber; then
wrought the carpenters, joiners, masons, and all other artificers
necessary to be had to glorify this noble feast." He tells us of
"expert cookes, and connyng persons in the art of cookerie; the
cookes wrought both day and night with suttleties and many crafty
devices, where lacked neither gold, silver, nor other costly things
meet for their purpose"&mdash;"280 beds furnished with all manner
of furniture to them, too long particularly to be rehearsed, but
all wise men do sufficiently know what belongeth to the furniture
thereof, and that is sufficient at this <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span> time to be said."
Wolsey's arrival during the feast is described quaintly enough:
"Before the second course my lord came in booted and spurred, all
sodainely amongst them <i>proface</i>;<a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> at whose
coming there was great joy, with rising every man from his place,
whom my lord caused to sit still, and keep their roomes, and being
in his apparel as he rode, called for a chayre and sat down in the
middest of the high paradise, laughing and being as merry as ever I
saw him in all my lyff." The whole party drank long and strong,
some of the Frenchmen were led off to bed, and in the chambers of
all was placed abundance of "wine and beere."</p>

<p>Henry VIII. added considerably to Wolsey's building, and in the
latter part of his reign, it became one of his principal
residences. Among the events connected with the palace are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Edward VI. was born at Hampton Court, October 12, 1537, and his
mother, Queen Jane Seymour, died there on the 14th of the same
month.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href=
"#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> Her corpse was conveyed to Windsor by
water, where she was buried, November 12. Catharine Howard was
openly showed as Queen, at Hampton Court, August 8, 1540. Catharine
Parr was married to the King at this palace, and proclaimed Queen,
July 12, 1543. In 1558, Mary and Philip kept Christmas here with
great solemnity, when the large hall was illuminated with 1,000
lamps. Queen Elizabeth frequently resided, and gave many superb
entertainments here, in her reign. In 1603-4, the celebrated
conference between Presbyterians and the Established Church was
held here before James I. as moderator, in a withdrawing-room
within the privy-chamber, on the subject of Conformity. All the
Lords of the Council were present, and the conference lasted three
days; a new translation of the Bible was ordered, and some
alterations were made in the Liturgy.<a id="footnotetag3" name=
"footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Charles I. retired to Hampton Court on account of the plague, in
1625, when a proclamation prohibited all communication between
London, Southwark, or Lambeth, and this place.<a id="footnotetag4"
name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
Charles was brought here by the army, August 24, 1647, and lived in
a state of splendid imprisonment, being allowed to keep up the
state and retinue of a court, till November 11, following, when he
made his escape<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a
href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> to the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>In 1651, the Honour and Palace of Hampton were sold to creditors
of the state; but previously to 1657 it came into the possession of
Cromwell, who made it one of his chief residences. Elizabeth, his
daughter, was here publicly married to the Lord Falconberg; and the
Protector's favourite child, Mrs. Claypoole, died here, and was
conveyed with great pomp to Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>The palace was occasionally inhabited by Charles II. and James
II. King William resided much at Hampton Court; he pulled down
great part of the old palace, which then consisted of five
quadrangles, and employed Sir Christopher Wren to build on its site
the Fountain Court, or State Apartments. In July, 1689, the Duke of
Gloucester, son of the Princess, afterwards Queen Anne, was born
here. The Queen sojourned at Hampton occasionally, as did her
successors George I. and II.; but George III. never resided here.
When his late serene highness William the Fifth, Stadtholder of the
United Provinces, was condemned to quit his country by the French,
this palace was appropriated to his use; and he resided here
several years. The principal domestic apartments of Hampton Court
are now occupied by different private families, who have grants for
life from the crown.</p>

<p>The palace consists of three grand quadrangles: the western
quadrangle, or entrance court is 167 feet 2 inches, north to south,
and 141 feet 7 inches, east to west. This leads to the second, or
middle quadrangle, 133 feet 6 inches, north to south, and 91 feet
10 inches, east to west; this is usually called the Clock Court,
from a curious astronomical clock by Tompion, over the gateway of
the eastern side; on the southern side is a colonnade of Ionic
pillars by Wren. On the north is the great hall: as this is not
mentioned by Cavendish, probably it was part of Henry's building.
It certainly was not finished till 1536 or 1537, as appears from
initials of the King and Jane Seymour, joined in a true lover's
knot, amongst the decorations; this hall is 106 feet long, and 40
broad. Queen Caroline had a theatre erected here, in which it was
intended that two plays should be acted weekly during the stay of
the Court; but only seven plays were performed in it by the Drury
Lane company,<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href=
"#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> and one afterwards before the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span> Duke
of Lorraine, afterwards Emperor of Germany. The theatrical
appurtenances were not, however, removed till the year 1798.
Adjoining the hall is the Board of Green Cloth Room, of nearly the
same date, and hung with fine tapestry.</p>

<p>The eastern quadrangle, or Fountain Court, erected by Sir
Christopher Wren for King William, in 1690, is 100 feet by 177 feet
3 inches. Here is the King's Gallery, 117 feet by 23 feet 6 inches,
which was fitted up for the Cartoons of Raphael. On the eastern
side of the court is a room in which George I. and George II.
frequently dined in public. North-west of the Fountain Court stands
the chapel, which forms the southern side of the quadrangle; this
was partly built by Wolsey, and was finished by Henry VIII. in
1536, or 1537. The windows were of beautifully stained glass, and
the walls decorated with paintings, but these embellishments were
demolished in the troublous times of 1745. The chapel was, however,
restored by Queen Anne; the floor is of black and white marble, the
pews are of Norway oak, and there is some fine carving by Gibbons;
the roof is plain Gothic with pendent ornaments.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible for us, within the limits of our columns
to do justice to the magnificence of Hampton Court. The grand
facade towards the garden extends 330 feet, and that towards the
Thames 328 feet. The portico and colonnade, of duplicated pillars
of the Ionic order, at the grand entrance, and indeed, the general
design of the elevations, are in splendid style. On the south side
of the palace is the privy garden, which was sunk ten feet, to open
a view from the apartments to the Thames. On the northern side is a
tennis court, and beyond that a gate which leads into the
wilderness or <i>Maze</i>.<a id="footnotetag7" name=
"footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> Further on
is the great gate of the gardens.</p>

<p>The gardens, which comprise about 44 acres, were originally laid
out by London and Wise. George III. gave the celebrated Brown
permission to make whatever improvements his fine taste might
suggest; but he declared his opinion that they appeared to the best
advantage in their original state, and they accordingly remain so
to this day. The extent of the kitchen gardens is about 12 acres.
In the privy garden is a grape house 70 feet in length, and 14 in
breadth; the interior being wholly occupied by one vine of the
black Hamburgh kind, which was planted in the year 1769, and has in
a single year, produced 2,200 bunches of grapes, weighing, on an
average, one pound each.</p>

<p>The grotesque forms of the gardens, and the mathematical taste
in which they are disposed, are advantageously seen in a bird's-eye
view as in the Engraving, which represents the tortuous beauty of
the parterres, and the pools, fountains, and statues with
characteristic accuracy. The formal avenues, radiating as it were,
from the gardens or centre, are likewise distinctly shown, as is
also the canal formed by Wolsey through the middle avenue. The
intervening space, then a parklike waste, is now planted with
trees, and stretches away to the village of Thames Ditton; and is
bounded on the south by the Thames, and on the north by the high
road to Kingston.</p>

<p>The palace is open to the public, and besides its splendid
apartments, and numerous buildings, there is a valuable collection
of pictures, which are too celebrated to need enumeration. A
curious change has taken place in the occupancy of some
apartments&mdash;many rooms originally intended for domestic
offices being now tenanted by gentry. The whole is a vast
assemblage of art, and reminds us of the palace of Versailles,
which is about the same distance from Paris as Hampton Court from
London.</p>

<h3>ESCAPE OF CHARLES II.</h3>

<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>

<p>In No. 376, of the MIRROR, is a communication from <i>W.W.</i>
respecting the pension granted by Charles II. to the Pendrils, for
aiding him in his escape, after the fatal battle of Worcester.
There was another family who enjoyed a pension from the same
monarch, named Tattersall, one of whom conveyed Charles from
Brighton in his open fishing-boat. A descendant is now living at
that place, but the family, through ignorance and neglect, have
ceased to enjoy the grant.</p>

<p>The house in which the king rested at Brighton, is now an inn,
in West Street, called the King's Head, and is kept by a Mr.
Eales.</p>

<h2>THE SKETCH-BOOK</h2>

<hr />
<h3>PHYSIOGNOMY OF HOUSES.</h3>

<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>

<p>Houses undoubtedly present to the eye of fancy, an appearance
analogous to physiognomical expression in men. The remark has been
made by more acute observers than myself.</p>

<p>Look at that beetle-browed, solemn looking mansion with a
ponderous hat-roof&mdash;I mean of slates, garnished with bay
windows&mdash;observe its heavy jaws of areas, its hard, close
mouth of a door; its dark, deep sunken eyes of windows peering out
from the heavy brow of dark stone coping that supports the slate
hat in question: what a contrast to the spruce mock gentility of
its neighbour, with a stand-up collar of white steps, a varnished
face, and a light, jaunty, yet stiff air, like a city apprentice in
his best clothes.</p>

<p>See the cap on the temple of that Chinese Mandarin, poking above
yon clump of firs, with its bell furniture; he seems pondering on
the aphorisms of Confucius, regardless of that booby faced
conservatory, whose bald, rounded pate glitters in the sun. Ah!
what have we here; a spruce masquerader in yellow straw hat, trying
to look rural with as much success as a reed thatched summer house.
Stand in this quiet nook a few hours, and give us the shadow of
your mushroom covering.</p>

<p>There is a poor, forlorn wretch with his rags fluttering about
him like a beggar&mdash;give him a penny&mdash;he must be in
distress&mdash;look at his shattered face and dilapidated form;
shored up upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id=
"page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> crutches, tottering on the brink of the
sewers&mdash;shores I mean&mdash;of eternity; behold his crushed
and crownless hat&mdash;his hollow eyes&mdash;his rheumy
visage&mdash;look at that petition penned on his breast. Poh! 'tis
a surveyor's notice to pull down. But, then, look at that plurality
parson with rotund prominence of portico, and red brick cheeks of
vast extent, and that high, steeple-crowned hat&mdash;look at the
smug, mean, insignificant dwarf of a meeting-house, sinking up to
its knees in a narrow lane, and looking as blank as a wall, with a
trap-door of a mouth, and a grating cast of eye. How yonder
bridegroom, just cemented in an alliance that will not last out his
lease of life, "spick and span new," all eyes, and a double row of
buttons ornamenting his latticed waistcoat, looks at his adored
opposite, who holds her Venetian parasol&mdash;sun
shade&mdash;before her face, glowing like a red brick wall in the
sun. Ah! his regards are attracted by a modest little nymph of the
grove, seated snugly in a sylvan recess, her pretty white cheeks
peeping out beneath the tresses of honeysuckle and woodbine that
veil her beauty. Well, <i>railing</i> is in this case allowable,
for see that brazen front of maiden sixty, guiltless of curls, with
a huge structure of bonnet cocked straight at the top of her head,
like the roof of a market-house, and her broad, square skirts of
faded green, deformed by formal knots of yew and holly. Look with
what a blushless face of triumph she eyes her poor tottering
neighbour opposite, who never appears destined "to suffer a
recovery." Oh, 'tis remorseless! But look down that vista of
charity children in slate coloured Quaker bonnets, stuck one
against the other in drab, like pins in a paper, but not so bright;
are they going to stand there for ever, with their governess at
their head, looking as smug and fubsy as the squat house at the
end? Why 'tis&mdash;street!&mdash;Look at the pump at the other
end, that might pass for an abridgment of a parish clerk&mdash;and
see, there comes stalking across the Green the parish beadle, with
a great white placard in his hat&mdash;you might well mistake him
for Alderman &mdash;&mdash;'s monument in red brick with the marble
tablet on the top of it. Ah! my pretty rustic&mdash;why your straw
hat and brown stuff frock, with white bib, and that gay flowered
apron, with the sprig of jessamine stuck at your side&mdash;you
look so homely and comely beneath the shade of that tall oak, that
I could fancy you were only the shepherd's cottage at the corner of
the grange. Bless me&mdash;here's a modern antique, masquerading in
the country!&mdash;why a village belle of queen Bess' days, looking

hands of his fancy architect. More mummery! why this gentleman
looks as fine and as foolish in his affectation of rugged points
and quaint angles, as a staring, white-washed, Gothic villa with
the paint not yet dry. Oh! there is certainly no denying that thou
art the primest of Quakers, Mr. Chapel, one that will not
countenance a <i>belle</i>, but lookest right onward in smooth and
demure solidity, with that strip of white path in front of thy
brown gravel waistcoat, and the ample skirts of thy road-coloured

ink bottle, upright in his button hole, and his pen-like poplar in
his hand; he is equally uncompromising, but looks with an eye of
stern regard upon that gay sprig of myrtle with his roof of a hat,
jauntily clapped on one side, and a towering charming feather,
streaming like smoke in the breeze. But whither have my vagaries
led me&mdash;here I am once more in the dullest of dull country
towns, over which strides the gouty old dean, like a Gothic arch
across a cathedral city; and see how the wealthy innkeeper dangles
his broad medal (sign of his having been in the yeomanry) that

<h2>MANNERS &amp; CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>CURIOUS CEREMONY OF DRIVING DEER THROUGH THE WATER (FORMERLY
PRACTISED) IN LYME PARK, CHESHIRE.</h3>

<br />
<br />


<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>

<p>Ormerod, in his splendid <i>History of Cheshire</i>, says, "The
park of Lyme, which is very extensive, is celebrated for the fine
flavour of its venison, and contains a herd of wild cattle, the
remains of a breed which has been kept here from time immemorial,
and is supposed indigenous. In the last century a custom was
observed here of driving the deer round the park about Midsummer,
or rather earlier, collecting them in a body before the house, and
then swimming them through a pool of water, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span> with which
the exhibition terminated." There is a large print of it by
Vivares, after a painting by T. Smith, representing Lyme Park
during the performance of the annual ceremony, with the great Vale
of Cheshire and Lancashire, as far as the Rivington Hills in the
distance, and in the foreground the great body of the deer passing
through the pool, the last just entering it, and the old stags
emerging on the opposite bank, two of which are contending with
their fore-feet, the horns at that season being too tender to
combat with. This "art of driving the deer" like a herd of ordinary
cattle, is stated on a monument, at Disley, to have been first
perfected by Joseph Watson, who died in 1753, at the age of 104,
"having been park-keeper at Lyme more than sixty-four years." The
custom, however, appears not to have been peculiar to Lyme, as Dr.
Whitaker describes, in his <i>Account of Townley</i>, (the seat of
a collateral line of Legh,) "near the summit of the park, and where
it declines to the south, the remains of a large pool, through
which tradition reports that the deer were driven by their keepers
in the manner still practised in the park at Lyme."<a id=

<p>Lyme Park is situated near the road from Manchester to London,
through Buxton, adjacent to the picturesque village of Disley.</p>

<p>Lyme Hall is the seat of the principal of the ancient family of
Leghs. Perkins <i>&agrave; Legh</i>, a Norman, who was buried in
Macclesfield Church, rendered considerable services in the battle
of Cressy, for which he was presented with the estate and lordship
of Lyme. The building is, in part, of the date of Elizabeth; and
the other a regular structure, from a design of Leoni.</p>

<h3>STANNARY PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>

<p>In the Forest of Dartmoor, Devonshire, between Tavistock and
Chegford, is a high hill, called Crocken Tor, where the tinners of
this county are obliged by their charter to assemble their
parliaments, or the jurats who are commonly gentlemen within the
jurisdiction, chosen from the four stannary courts of coinage in
this county, of which the lord-warden is judge. The jurats being
met to the number sometimes of two or three hundred, in this
desolate place, are quite exposed to the weather and have no other
place to sit upon but a moor-stone bench, and no refreshments but
what they bring with them; for this reason the steward immediately
adjourns the court to Tavistock, or some other stannary town.</p>

<p>In different parts of the North of England it is customary for
the labouring men to come before their masters at the close of
their <i>dowruck</i> (day's work,) and inform him of their labours;
the number of hours their work took them are cut in notches upon an
ash stick, and at the end of the week when the men are paid, the
stick is produced, which immediately shows what each man is
entitled to.</p>

<h3>JACK OF HILTON, THE BRAZEN IMAGE, ALIAS AN AEOLIPILE.</h3>

<br />
<br />


<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>

<p>Dr. Plot, in his <i>History of Staffordshire</i>, says, "The
following service is due from the Lord of Essington, in
Staffordshire, to the Lord of Hilton, about a mile distant, viz.
that the Lord of the Manor of Essington, shall bring a goose every
New year's day, and drive it round the fire in the hall at Hilton,
at least three times, whilst <i>Jack of Hilton</i> is blowing the
fire. Now Jack of Hilton is a little hollow image of brass, of
about twelve inches high, kneeling upon his left knee, and holding
his right hand upon his head, having a little hole in the place of
the mouth, about the bigness of a great pin's head, and another in
the back about two-thirds of an inch diameter, at which last hole
it is filled with water, it holding about four pints and a quarter,
which when set to a strong fire, evaporates after the same manner
as in an <i>Aeolipile</i>, and vents itself at the smaller hole at
the mouth in a constant blast, blowing the fire so strongly that it
is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg
103]</span> very audible, and makes a sensible impression on that
part of the fire where the blast lights, as I found by experience,
May 26, 1680. After the Lord of Essington, or his deputy, or
bayliffe, has driven the goose round the fire (at least three
times) whilst this image blows it, he carries it into the kitchen
of Hilton Hall, and delivers it to the cook, who having dressed it,
the Lord of Essington, or his bayliffe, by way of further service,
brings it to the table of the Lord paramount of Hilton and
Essington, and receives a dish of meat from the said Lord of
Hilton's table, for his own mess."</p>

<p>The Aeolipile, in hydraulics, is an instrument consisting of a
hollow metallic ball, with a slender neck or pipe, arising from it.
This being filled with water, and thus exposed to the fire,
produces a vehement blast of wind.</p>

<p>This instrument, Des Cartes and others, have made use of, to
account for the natural cause and generation of wind; and hence its
name, Aeolipile, <i>pila Aeoli</i>, Aeolus's ball.</p>

<p>In Italy it is said that the Aeolipile is commonly made use of
to cure smoky chimneys; for being hung over the fire, the blast
arising from it carries up the loitering smoke along with it. This
instrument was known to the ancients, and is mentioned by
Vitruvius.</p>

<p>Some late authors have discovered the extraordinary use to which
the frauds of the heathen priesthood applied the Aeolipile, viz.
the working of sham miracles. Besides <i>Jack of Hilton</i>, which
had been an ancient Saxon, image, or idol, Mr. Weber shows, that
<i>Pluster</i>, a celebrated German idol, is also of the Aeolipile
kind, and in virtue thereof, could do noble feats: being filled
with a fluid, and then set on the fire, it would be covered with
sweat, and as the heat increased, would at length burst out into
flames.</p>

<p>An Aeolipile of great antiquity, made of brass, was some years
since dug up on the site of the Basingstoke Canal, and presented to
the Antiquarian Society of London. Instead of being globular, with
a bent tube, it is in the form of a grotesque human figure, and the
blast proceeds from its mouth.</p>

<hr />
<h3>ORIGIN OF WEARING THE VEIL.</h3>

<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>

<p>The origin of the veil is referred by the Greeks to modesty and
bashfulness.</p>

<p>About thirty furlongs from the city of Sparta, Icarius placed a
statue of MODESTY, for the purpose of perpetuating the following
incident:&mdash;Icarius having married his daughter to Ulysses,
solicited his son-in-law to fix his household in Sparta, and remain
there with his wife, to which Ulysses would not consent.</p>

<p>Icarius made the request to his daughter, conjuring her not to
abandon him, but seeing her ready to depart with Ulysses, for
Ithaca, he redoubled his efforts to detain her, nor could he be
prevailed on to desist from following the chariot on the way.</p>

<p>Ulysses wearied with the importunities of Icarius, said to his
wife, "<i>You</i> can best answer this request; it is yours to
determine whether you will remain with your father at Sparta, or
depart with your husband for Ithaca; you are mistress of the
decision."</p>

<p>The beautiful Penelope finding herself in this dilemma, blushed,
and without making the least reply, drew her veil over her face,
thereby intimating a denial to her father's request, and sunk into
the arms of her husband.</p>

<p>Icarius, very sensibly affected by this behaviour, and being
desirous of transmitting it to posterity by the most durable
monument, consecrated a statue to Modesty, on the very spot where
Penelope had thrown the veil over her face; that after her it might
be a universal symbol of delicacy among the fair sex.</p>

<p>C.K.W.</p>

<hr />
<p>The manners of the Welsh must have been even less delicate than
those of the Anglo-Saxons; for they thought it necessary to make a
law, "that none of the courtiers should give the queen a blow, or
snatch any thing with violence from her, under the penalty of
incurring her majesty's displeasure."</p>

<hr />
<h3>FUNERAL OF A BURMESE PRIEST.</h3>

<p>The funeral pile, in this case, is a car on wheels; and the body
is blown away, from a huge wooden cannon or mortar, with the
purpose, I believe, of conveying the soul more rapidly to heaven!
Immense crowds are collected on occasions of these funerals, which,
far from being conducted with mourning or solemnity, are occasions
of rude mirth and boisterous rejoicing. Ropes are attached to each
extremity of the car, and pulled in opposite directions by adverse
parties; one of these being for consuming the body, the other for
opposing it. The latter are at length overcome, fire is set to the
pile amidst loud acclamations, and the ceremony is
consummated.&mdash;<i>Crawford's Embassy to Ava</i>.</p>

<h4>(<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)</h4>

<p>The various ages, interests, and tastes which govern the
progressive growth of cities, seem to be irremediable causes of the
irregularity and inconvenience of their final formations or
plans&mdash;and until this illustrious age of magnanimous projects
and improvements, it would have been thought ridiculous to offer
any radical expedient for a general improvement in the plans of
cities; but <i>now</i> that we see <i>new</i> cities growing round
the metropolis, and new towns planned for the distant dominions of
Great Britain, it seems to be a convenient season for explaining my
notions respecting the general plan of a city, with regard <i>only
to the directions of the streets</i>, which after the repeated
consideration of fifty years, I have concluded may, and ought to
be, all straight streets, from <i>every extremity</i>, to the
opposite, whatever be the form of the <i>outermost</i> boundary of
the city or town.&mdash;These <i>conclusions</i> would most
probably have passed off in silence, but for an accidental fancy
arising in my mind, on reading lately in the Psalms, "<i>Jerusalem
is a city that is in unity with itself</i>." This text awakened my
dormant ideas on the proper formation of streets, and anticipating
the reunion of the Jews, I began the accompanying sketch for a
"<i>Holy City</i>," or "<i>a New Jerusalem</i>," which accounts for
the twelve gates according with the original number of the tribes
of Israel, and the ten streets which diverge from each gate are
symbolic of the Ten Commandments, wherein they were commanded to
walk; the twelve circular areas I thought to be properly dedicated
to the Twelve Apostles of Christianity, under the idea that when
the Jews are again called together it will be under the new
covenant of Christianity, so that nothing could (in that case) be
more appropriate than placing the original propagators of it where
so many paths led towards them&mdash;and after fixing the place of
public worship in the centre, my orthodoxy ceased to affect my
scheme, for want of that technical knowledge which further detail
would require&mdash;and having accomplished my favourite
determination of planning a town without winding streets or crooked
lanes. I offer it to the MIRROR as an <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> amusing novelty for the
entertainment of its numerous readers. I think it would be not
inappropriate to call it the Royal City of <i>Victoria</i>.</p>

likewise indebted for the Plan for a Maze, in our Vol. vii. page

found exactly such a one in Assyria or Egypt,&mdash;of antique

<h2>THE SELECTOR;</h2>

<h3>AND LITERARY NOTICES OF <i>NEW WORKS.</i></h3>

<hr />
<h3>NEW EDITION OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS.</h3>

<p>It is rather late in the day to speak of what is technically
termed the "getting-up" of this elegant edition of the most popular
works of our time. There are now three volumes
published&mdash;<i>Waverley</i>, in two vols. and one vol. or half
of <i>Guy Mannering</i>. Each of the former contains upwards of 400
pages, and the latter nearly that number&mdash;beautifully printed
in what we call a very inviting type, on excellent paper, of rich
colour, and not too garish for the eye of the reader. The
engravings to <i>Waverley</i> are by Graves, C. Rolls, and Raddon,
after E.P. and J. Stephanoff, Newton, and Landseer&mdash;a
frontispiece and plate title page and vignette to each volume. To
our taste the vignettes are exquisite&mdash;one by Landseer,
<i>David Gellatley, with Ban and Buscar</i>, is extremely
beautiful. The illustrations to the volume of <i>Guy Mannering</i>
are by Duncan, and C.G. Cooke, after Leslie and Kidd. The volumes
are in substantial canvass binding. Their low price, a crown
a-piece, is the marvel of bookselling, for were they only reprints
without copyright, they would be unprecedentedly cheap. The whole
series will extend to forty volumes, to be published in three
years, and will cost ten pounds. Fifteen-pence a week for the above
term will thus provide a family with one of the most elegant
drawing-room libraries that can be desired. They will about occupy
three <i>cheffonier</i> shelves;&mdash;or what delightful volumes
for fire-side shelves, or a "little book-room," or a breakfast
parlour opening on a carpet of lawn&mdash;or to read by the hour,
with a golden-haired lady-friend, and chat awhile, and then turn to
the most attractive scenes in the novel, while we ourselves are
perhaps enacting the hero in a romance of real life. Few novels
admit of a second reading; but the <i>Waverley</i> series will
never lose their attraction&mdash;and to remember when and where,
and with whom you first read each of them, may perhaps revive many
pleasantries.</p>

<p>Of the literary Notes and emendations of the present edition, we
have already expressed our opinion by the selection of several of
them for the pages of the MIRROR; and in the progress of the
publication, we shall endeavour to award similar justice to each of
the works.</p>

<p>In the <i>Athenaeum</i>, of August 5, the presumed profit on the
whole edition is estimated at &pound;100,000.! The calculation of
the sale of 12,000 of each work is a reasonable one, and splendid
as, in that case, the reward will be, the reading-public will be
the gainers.</p>

<hr />
<h3>THE FAMILY LIBRARY.</h3>

<h3><i>History of the Jews.</i></h3>

<p>We scarcely know how to do justice to the high character of the
series of volumes now publishing under this denomination. In
printing and embellishment they take the lead of the Periodical
Works of our day, (and some of these are extremely beautiful,)
while their literary worth is even of superior order. Although they
are matter-of-fact works&mdash;as in history and
biography&mdash;they are not mere compilations of dry details and
uninteresting lives; but they are so interspersed with new views,
and the facts are so often re-written, that the whole have the
appearance of original works. Excellent principles, and economy of
cost are, likewise, two important points of their recommendations;
for many works which have already appeared on the same subjects,
have been deformed by party spirit, and written to serve a sect, or
are so expensive as to be purchaseable only by the wealthy ranks,
and scarcely accessible by the middle classes of society; whereas
the Family Library is published at a rate within the reach of
two-thirds of the reading public, who may therefore possess what
they read, and appreciate the value of these volumes as works of
reference and authority.</p>

<p>The division of the series which has called forth this notice,
is No. 5, or the first volume of the <i>History of the Jews</i>, to
be completed in three volumes, by the Rev. H.H. Milman, Professor
of Poetry at Oxford, and the author of the splendid poem&mdash;The
Fall of Jerusalem; and judging by the portion before us, this work
will form one of the most attractive in the whole series. In proof
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg
106]</span> of this it would be easy to select many passages which
are beautifully picturesque; a few, however, will suffice:</p>

<p>"The Jews, without reference to their religious belief, are
among the most remarkable people in the annals of mankind. Sprung
from one stock, they pass the infancy of their nation in a state of
servitude in a foreign country, where, nevertheless, they increase
so rapidly, as to appear on a sudden the fierce and irresistible
conquerors of their native valleys in Palestine. There they settle
down under a form of government and code of laws totally unlike
those of any other rude or civilized community. They sustain a long
and doubtful conflict, sometimes enslaved, sometimes victorious,
with the neighbouring tribes. At length, united under one monarchy,
they gradually rise to the rank of a powerful, opulent, and
commercial people. Subsequently weakened by internal discord, they
are overwhelmed by the vast monarchies which arose on the banks of
the Euphrates, and transplanted into a foreign region. They are
partially restored, by the generosity or policy of the Eastern
sovereigns, to their native land. They are engaged in wars of the
most romantic gallantry, in assertion of their independence,
against the Syro-Grecian successors of Alexander. Under Herod, they
rise to a second era of splendour, as a dependent kingdom of Rome:
finally, they make the last desperate resistance to the universal
dominion of the Caesars. Scattered from that period over the face
of the earth&mdash;hated, scorned, and oppressed, they subsist, a
numerous and often a thriving people; and in all the changes of
manners and opinions retain their ancient institutions, their
national character, and their indelible hope of restoration to
grandeur and happiness in their native land. Thus the history of
this, perhaps the only unmingled race, which can boast of high
antiquity, leads us through every gradation of society and brings
us into contact with almost every nation which commands our
interest in the ancient world; the migratory pastoral population of
Asia; Egypt, the mysterious parent of arts, science, and
legislation; the Arabian Desert; the Hebrew theocracy under the
form of a federative agricultural republic, their kingdom powerful
in war and splendid in peace; Babylon, in its magnificence and
downfall; Grecian arts and luxury endeavouring to force an
unnatural refinement within the pale of the rigid Mosaic
institutions; Roman arms waging an exterminating war with the
independence even of the smallest states; it descends, at length,
to all the changes in the social state of the modern European and
Asiatic nations."</p>

<p>At page 32, there is an interesting picture of the state of
society in Patriarchal times&mdash;the whole of the life of Moses
is extremely well written&mdash;the description of the Plague is
indeed terrific&mdash;and the death and character of the Prophet
drawn with a masterly and vigorous hand. The reigns of David and
Solomon, as might be expected, are magnificently told. Among the
picturesque sketches none exceed the&mdash;</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF PALESTINE.</h3>

<p>"It is almost impossible to calculate with accuracy the area of
a country, the frontier of which is irregular on every side. Lowman
has given three different estimates of the extent of territory
occupied by the twelve tribes, the mean between the two extremes
approaches probably the nearest to the truth. According to this
computation, the Jewish dominion, at the time of the Division, was
180 miles long, by 130 wide, and contained 14,976,000 acres. This
quantity of land will divide to 600,000 men, about 21-1/2 acres in
property, with a remainder of 1,976,000 acres for the Levitical
cities, the princes of tribes, the heads of families, and other
public uses. Assuming this estate of 21-1/2 acres, assigned to each
household, of course a larger proportion of pasture must have been
given to those tribes who subsisted on their herds and flocks, than
of arable to those who lived by tillage, the portions of the
latter, therefore, must be considerably reduced. On the other hand,
the extraordinary fertility of the whole country must be taken into
the account. No part was waste; very little was occupied by
unprofitable wood; the more fertile hills were cultivated in
artificial terraces, others were hung with orchards of fruit trees;
the more rocky and barren districts were covered with vineyards.
Even in the present day, the wars and misgovernment of ages have
not exhausted the natural richness of the soil. Galilee, says Malte
Brun, would be a paradise were it inhabited by an industrious
people, under an enlightened government. No land could be less
dependent on foreign importation; it bore within itself every thing
that could be necessary for the subsistence and comfort of a simple
agricultural people. The climate was healthy, the seasons regular;
the former rains, which fell about October, after the vintage,
prepared the ground <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id=
"page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> for the seed; the latter, which
prevailed during March and the beginning of April, made it grow
rapidly. Directly the rains ceased, the grain ripened with still
greater rapidity, and was gathered in before the end of May. The
summer months were dry and very hot, but the nights cool and
refreshed by copious dews. In September, the vintage was gathered.
Grain of all kinds, wheat, barley, millet, zea, and other sorts,
grew in abundance; the wheat commonly yielded thirty for one.
Besides the vine and the olive, the almond, the date, figs of many
kinds, the orange, the pomegranates, and many other fruit-trees,
flourished in the greatest luxuriance. Great quantity of honey was
collected. The balm tree, which produced the opobalsamum, a great
object of trade, was probably introduced from Arabia in the time of
Solomon. It nourished about Jericho and in Gilead."</p>

<p>This is but a portion of the sketch. The wealth and commerce of
the country is thus told:</p>

<p>"The only public revenue of the Hebrew commonwealth was that of
the sacred treasury, the only public expenditure that of the
religious worship. This was supported by a portion of the spoils
taken in war; the first fruits, which in their institution were no
more than could be carried in a basket, at a later period were
rated to be one part in sixty; the redemption of the first born,
and of whatever was vowed to the Lord. Almost every thing of the
last class might be commuted for money according to a fixed scale.
The different annual festivals were well calculated to promote
internal commerce: maritime or foreign trade, is scarcely mentioned
in the law, excepting in two obscure prophetic intimations of
advantages, which the tribes of Dan and Zebulun were to derive from
their maritime situation. On this subject the lawgiver could have
learned nothing in Egypt. The commerce of that country was confined
to the inland caravan trade. The Egyptians hated or dreaded the
sea, which they considered either the dwelling of the evil
principle, or the evil principle itself. At all events, the Hebrews
at this period were either blind to the maritime advantages of
their situation, or unable to profit by them. The ports were the
last places they conquered. Sidon, if indeed within their boundary,
never lost its independence; Tyre, if it existed, was a town too
obscure to be named; Ecdippa and Acco remained in the power of the
Canaanites; Joppa is not mentioned as a port till much later. The
manufactures of the people supplied their own wants; they brought
from Egypt the arts of weaving woollens and linens, stuffs made of
fine goats' hair, and probably cotton; of dying in various colours,
and bleaching, and of embroidering; of many kinds of carpenter's
work; of building, some of the rules of which were regulated by
law; of making earthenware vessels; of working in iron, brass, and
the precious metals, both casting them and forming them with the
tool; of gilding, engraving seals, and various other kinds of
ornamental work, which were employed in the construction of the
altars and sacred vessels of the Tabernacle."</p>

<p>Among the illustrative passages we notice the following
exquisite paragraph on the&mdash;</p>

<h3>HEBREW POETS.</h3>

<p>"THE three most eminent men in the Hebrew annals, Moses, David,
and Solomon, were three of their most distinguished poets. The
hymns of David excel no less in sublimity and tenderness of
expression than in loftiness and purity of religious sentiment. In
comparison with them the sacred poetry of all other nations sinks
into mediocrity. They have embodied so exquisitely the universal
language of religious emotion, that (a few fierce and vindictive
passages excepted, natural in the warrior-poet of a sterner age,)
they have entered with unquestioned propriety into the ritual of
the holier and more perfect religion of Christ. The songs which
cheered the solitude of the desert caves of Engedi, or resounded
from the voice of the Hebrew people as they wound along the glens
or the hill-sides of Judaea, have been repeated for ages in almost
every part of the habitable world, in the remotest islands of the
ocean, among the forests of America or the sands of Africa. How
many human hearts have they softened, purified, exalted!&mdash;of
how many wretched beings have they been the secret
consolation!&mdash;on how many communities have they drawn down the
blessings of Divine Providence, by bringing the affections into
unison with their deep, devotional fervour."</p>

<p>The present volume extends from the time of Abraham to the
Babylonian Captivity. It is illustrated with three excellent maps,
and a few wood cuts; but we are convinced that we need add nothing
further of its contents to recommend the <i>History of the Jews</i>
to the attention <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id=

most splendid and fascinating works in our recollection.</p>

<h3>LIBRARY OF ENTERTAINING KNOWLEDGE.</h3>

<p>The Fourth Part of this well-arranged publication, is "<i>The
Pursuit of Knowledge under difficulties illustrated by
Anecdotes</i>." The matter is judiciously divided into chapters, as
"Strength of the Passion for Knowledge&mdash;Humble Station no
Obstacle&mdash;Obscure Origin&mdash;Artists rising from the lower
to the higher classes&mdash;Late Learners&mdash;Early Age of Great
Men&mdash;Self-educated Men&mdash;Literary Pursuits of
Soldiers&mdash;Merchants, Booksellers, and Printers." All these
heads are illustrated by anecdotes&mdash;some of them well known,
others drawn from uncommon sources&mdash;and all replete with
useful information, and furnishing an exhaustless store of
entertainment. Such a volume is, indeed, <i>a book for the
people</i>, and will do more towards the spread of knowledge, and
the excitement of those engaged in its pursuit, than scores of
fine-spun theories cramped up with technicalities. For young people
we consider this book a real treasure; since the examples selected
are not those of men who became intoxicated with their success, or
gave up useful occupation for mere elegant literature or
experimental knowledge; but the instances are chiefly of such as
have turned their genius to good account, or for the benefit of
themselves and their fellow men. We call such men the
<i>honourables of the land</i>, whose examples should be written in
letters of gold, and on monuments of marble, as helps to social
duties and for the imitation of after times.</p>

<p>We have marked for our next number a few extracts which will be
interesting to our readers to explain the mode by which the heads
of a chapter are illustrated. The biographettes of John Hunter,
Simpson, J. Stone, and Fergusson, and the introductory
illustrations of Newton, are the most striking portions of the
volume; and they maybe read and re-read with increasing advantage.
Of Hunter and Fergusson there are good portraits.</p>

<h3><i>Block Machinery.</i></h3>

<p>Mr. Faraday has lately described at the Royal Institution,
Brunel's Block Machinery at Portsmouth, with a set of magnificent
models of this admirable invention, which were lent to the Society
by the Navy Board. They consist of eight separate machines, which
work in succession, so as to begin and finish off a two-sheaved
block four inches in length. These were put by Messrs. Maudsley and
Field's men (who made them) into such communication and action, as
to perform the set of operations in the most perfect manner.</p>

<p>Mr. F. briefly stated that the Block Machinery of Portsmouth, by
adjustments, could manufacture blocks of 100 different
sizes&mdash;could with thirty men make 100 per hour; and from the
time of its completion in 1804-5 to the present day, had required
no repairs from Maudsley, the original manufacturer. The total cost
was given at 46,000 <i>l</i>., and the saving per annum in time of
war 25,000 <i>l</i>. This is a paragon of art which we could see
again and again.</p>

<h3><i>Enameled Street Names.</i></h3>

<p>The names of the Streets in Paris have been recently put up on
enameled plates; the ground being blue, and the letters white. The
substance on which the enameling is performed is lava in slabs; the
same substance has since been used as the basis of certain enameled
designs; it is much superior in some points to porcelain in this
application, because the necessary exposure to fire does not cause
it to crack in the manner that porcelain does.&mdash;<i>From the
French</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Preservation of Wine Must.</i></h3>

<p>Charcoal was added to grape must, in the proportion of 100
grains to a litre (2.1 pints), or if very much inclined to ferment,
more charcoal was used. When the liquid had settled, and become
clear and colourless, it was removed from the charcoal, and put
into bottles or casks, to be closed up, and preserved. It will not
enter into fermentation, even in close vessels; for the charcoal
has absorbed the ferment. Nevertheless, the ferment has not lost
its powers by combination with the carbon; for, if left in the
must, the latter begins to ferment, but only where in contact with
the former.&mdash;<i>From the French</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Weevils in Granaries.</i></h3>

<p>Wash the floor and sides of the granary with a mixture of urine
and water before the corn is stored up; this washing is to be
repeated several times, the walls and floors of the granary being
well swept between each operation.&mdash;<i>From the
French</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg
109]</span></p>

<h3><i>French Eggs and Apples.</i></h3>

<p>In the year 1827 there were 63,109,618 hen's eggs, and 14,182
bushels of apples imported from France into England.</p>

<h3><i>Enlargement of Artichokes.</i></h3>

<p>The gardeners in the south of France increase the size of
artichokes by splitting the stem into four at the base of the
receptacle, and introducing two small sticks in the form of a
cross. This operation should not be made until the stem has
attained the height it ought to have.&mdash;<i>From the
French</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Preservation of Potatoes.</i></h3>

<p>Potatoes at the depth of one foot in the ground, produce shoots
near the end of spring; at the depth of two feet they appear in the
middle of summer; at three feet they are very short, and never come
to the surface; and between three and five feet they cease to
vegetate. In consequence of observing these effects several parcels
of potatoes were buried in a garden at the depth of three and a
half feet, and were not removed. until after an interval of one or
two years. They were then found without, any shoots, and possessing
their original freshness, firmness, goodness, and taste. <i>From
the French</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Leeches.</i></h3>

<p>It is well known that atmospheric changes have a remarkable
influence upon leeches. In 1825, M. Derheim, of St. Omer, ascribes
the almost sudden death of them at the approach of, or during
storms, to the coagulation of the blood of these creatures, caused
by the impression of the atmospheric electricity.&mdash;<i>From the
French</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Carpenter's Microscope.</i></h3>

<p>Mr. Carpenter's achromatic solar microscope has now a white
circular area of nine feet in diameter, to receive the images of
the objects upon, some of which are magnified to the enormous size
of upwards of eight feet in length!</p>

<p>Mr. Carpenter's lucernal microscopes are now arranged in a kind
of temple, placed in the middle of a room, and illuminated by the
light of one powerful Argand lamp, so as to be independent of all
natural light; thus, in all seasons, even in cloudy weather, the
objects are as brilliantly displayed as they could be last year
when the sun shone.&mdash;<i>Gill's Repository</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Beet Root Sugar.</i></h3>

<p>There are now in France upwards of one hundred manufactories of
beet root sugar, from which were produced last year upwards of
5,000 tons of sugar, worth 60 <i>l.</i> per ton, or 300,000
<i>l</i>.; the profit of which is estimated at 15 <i>l.</i> an
acre; but, says one of the manufacturers, the process may be so far
improved, that sugar will be made in France from the beet root at
30 <i>l.</i> per ton, which will increase the profit to 24
<i>l.</i> an acre. A writer in the <i>Quarterly Journal of
Agriculture</i> observes that "it is difficult to conceive that one
half of the sugar consumed in Great Britain, or in all Europe, will
not, in a few years, be home-made beet root sugar."</p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS</h2>

<hr />
<h3>LORD BYRON AND SIR WALTER SCOTT AT WATERLOO.</h3>

<h4><i>By a Sexagenarian.</i></h4>

<p>In his transit to Italy in August, 1816, Lord Byron visited
Brussels (where I was residing) accompanied by Dr. Polidori. The
moment I heard of his arrival, I waited on him, and was received
with the greatest cordiality and kindness.</p>

<p>As he proposed visiting Waterloo on the following morning, I
offered my services as his cicerone, which were graciously
accepted, and we set out at an early hour, accompanied by his
<i>compagnon de voyage</i>. The weather was propitious, but the
poet's spirits seemed depressed, and we passed through the gloomy
forest of Soignies without much conversation. As the plan of the
inspection of the field had been left to me, I ordered our
postilion to drive to Mont St. Jean, without stopping at Waterloo.
We got out at the monuments. Lord Byron gazed about for five
minutes without uttering a syllable; at last, turning to me, he
said&mdash;"I am not disappointed. I have seen the plains of
Marathon, and these are as fine. Can you tell me," he continued,
"where Picton fell? because I have heard that my friend Howard was
killed at his side, and nearly at the same moment."</p>

<p>The spot was well known, and I pointed with my finger to some
trees near it, at the distance of one hundred and fifty yards: we
walked to the spot. "Howard," said his lordship, with a sigh, "was
my relation and dear friend; but we quarrelled, and I was in the
wrong; we were, however, reconciled, at which I now rejoice." He
spoke these words with great feeling, and we returned to examine
the monument of Sir Alexander Gordon, a broken column, on which he
made some criticisms, bestowing <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span> great praise on the
fraternal affection of his brother, who had erected it. He did not
seem much interested about the positions of the troops, which I
pointed out to him; and we got into our carriage, and drove to the
Ch&acirc;teau Goumont, the poet remaining silent, pensive, and in a
musing mood, which I took care not to interrupt.</p>

<p>The gallant defence of this post seemed to interest him more,
and I recapitulated all the particulars I knew of the attack. From
the bravery displayed by the handful of troops (the Guards) who
defended it, it has acquired its reputation. Though they were
reinforced more than once, the number never exceeded twelve
hundred; and notwithstanding the enemy having, by battering down
the gate of the farmyard, and setting fire to the straw in it, got
possession of the outer works, in the evening attack, they could
make no impression on the strong hold, the garden&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Whose close pleach'd walks and bowers have been</p>

<p>The deadly marksman's lurking screen."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>They reaped no advantage by these assaults; on the contrary,
they sacrificed a great many brave men without any purpose. It was
a most important post; for had they succeeded in getting possession
of it, and driving out our troops, their guns would have enfiladed
us, and we should have been obliged to change our front. The
pompous title of <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> gives a little additional
importance to this position, though it is only a miserable dwelling
of two stories, somewhat resembling the habitations of our
<i>Bonnet Lairds</i> about the beginning of the last century. The
area of the house is about two Scotch acres, including the garden.
The clipped and shady walks have been long since cut down, which
takes away much interest from it; and the stupid Fleming to whom it
belonged, cut down the young trees in front of it, because they had
been wounded by the bullets, which he was informed "would cause
them to bleed to death!" The nobleman who now possesses it, had,
with better taste, repaired the ch&acirc;teau, and will not permit
any alteration in its appearance.</p>

<p>I asked Byron what he thought of Mr. Scott's "Field of
Waterloo," just published&mdash;if it was fair to ask one poet his
opinion of a living contemporary. "Oh," said he, "quite fair;
besides, there is not much subject for criticism in this hasty
sketch. The reviewers call it a <i>falling off</i>; but I am sure
there is no poet living who could have written so many good lines
on so meagre a subject, in so short a time. Scott," he added, "is a
fine poet, and a most amiable man. We are great friends. As a prose
writer, he has no rival; and has not been approached since
Cervantes, in depicting manners. His tales are my constant
companions. It is highly absurd his denying, what every one that
knows him believes, his being the author of these admirable works.
Yet no man is obliged to give his name to the public, except he
chooses so to do; and Scott is not likely to be compelled by the
law, for he does not write libels, nor a line of which he may be
ashamed." He said a great deal more in praise of his friend, for
whom he had the highest respect and regard. "I wish," added the
poet, with feeling, "it had been my good fortune to have had such a
Mentor. No author," he observed, "had deserved more from the
public, or has been so liberally rewarded. Poor Milton got only
15<i>l.</i> for his 'Paradise Lost,' while a modern poet has as
much for a stanza." I know not if he made any allusion to himself
in this remark, but it has been said that Murray paid him that sum
for every verse of "Childe Harold."</p>

<p>Lord Byron, in reading aloud the stanzas of Mr. Scott,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"For high, and deathless is the name,</p>

<p>Oh Hougoinont, thy ruins claim!</p>

<p>The sound of Cressy none shall own,</p>

<p>And Agincourt shall be unknown,</p>

<p>And Blenheim be a nameless spot</p>

<p>Long ere thy glories are forgot," &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>he exclaimed, striking the page with his hand, "I'll be
d&mdash;&mdash;d if they will, Mr. Scott, be forgot!"</p>

<p>SIR WALTER SCOTT.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott visited Brussels about the middle of August,
1816, when I had the good fortune to meet him at the house of Sir
Frederick Adam, who was prevented by a wound from joining his
brigade, though he was able to do the duties of the small garrison
there.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott accepted my services to conduct him to Waterloo. The
general's aid-de-camp was also of the party, Mr. Scott being
accompanied by two friends, his fellow travellers. He made no
secret of his having undertaken to write something on the battle;
and he took the greater interest on this account in every thing
that he saw. Besides, he had never seen a field of such a conflict;
and never having been before on the Continent, it was all new to
his comprehensive mind. The day was beautiful; and I had the
precaution to send out a couple of saddle-horses, that he might not
be fatigued in walking over <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> the fields which had been recently
ploughed up. The animal he rode was so quiet that he was much
gratified, and had an opportunity of examining every spot of the
positions of both armies; and seemed greatly delighted, especially
with the Farm of Goumont, where he loitered a couple of hours. In
our rounds we fell in with Monsieur Da Costar, with whom he got
into conversation, though I had told him he was an impostor. But he
had attracted so much notice by his pretended story of being about
the person of Napoleon, that he was of too much importance to be
passed by: I did not, indeed, know as much of this fellow's
Charlatanism at that time as afterwards, when I saw him confronted
with a blacksmith of La Belle Alliance, who had been his companion
in a hiding-place, ten miles from the field, during the whole day;
a fact which he could not deny. But he had got up a tale so
plausible, and so profitable, that he could afford to bestow
hush-money on the companion of his flight, so that the imposition
was but little known, and strangers continued to be gulled. He had
picked up a good deal of information about the positions and
details of the battle, and being naturally a sagacious Wallon, and
speaking French pretty fluently, he became the favourite
<i>cicerone</i>, and every lie he told was taken for gospel. Year
after year, until his death, in 1824, he continued his popularity,
and raised the price of his rounds from a couple of francs to five;
besides as much for the hire of a horse, his own property; for he
pretended that the fatigue of walking so many hours was beyond his
powers. It has been said, that in this way he realized every summer
a couple of hundred Napoleons. It is surprising how any one could
believe the story he told; for supposing that he had been seized
upon by Napoleon, what use could such a vagabond be as a guide?
What was he to show? The British army was staring the Emperor in
the face at a mile distant. This <i>soi-disant</i> hero could only
be an incumbrance during the conflict, if his courage could have
been screwed up to remain at Napoleon's side, as he pretended he
had done, and that when he became panicstruck on the approach of
the Prussians, he was rewarded for his services with a twenty-franc
coin. He even pointed out the actual spot where he stood with the
Emperor on the <i>chauss&eacute;e</i>&mdash;heard him exclaim
"Sauve qui peut!" and saw him mount his horse, and
brush!&mdash;<i>facts</i>, which are become historical!</p>

<p>When Sir Walter had examined every point of defence and attack
we adjourned to the "Original Duke of Wellington," at Waterloo, to
dinner, after the fatigues of the ride. Here he had a crowded
lev&eacute;e of peasants, and collected a great many trophies, from
cuirasses down to buttons and bullets. He picked up himself many
little relics, and was fortunate in purchasing a grand cross of the
legion of honour. But the most precious relic was presented to him
by my wife&mdash;a French soldier's book, well stained with blood,
and containing some poetical effusions, called "Troubadours," which
he found so interesting that he translated them into English, and
they were introduced into his "Paul's Letters;" on the publication
of which he did her the honour of sending her a copy, with a most
flattering letter, to say, "that he considered her gift as the most
valuable of all his Waterloo relics."</p>

<p>On our return from the field, he kindly passed the evening with
us, and a few friends whom we invited to meet him. He charmed us
with his delightful conversation, and was in great spirits from the
agreeable day he had passed; and with great good humour promised to
write a stanza in the lady's Album. The following morning he called
to achieve this; and I put him into my little library, the door of
which I locked to prevent interruption, as a great many of my
friends had paraded in the <i>Parc</i> opposite my window to get a
peep of the celebrated man, many having dogged him from his
hotel.</p>

<p>Brussels affords but little worthy of the notice of such a
traveller as the author of "Waverley;" but he greatly admired the
splendid tower of the Maison de Ville, and the ancient sculpture
and style of architecture of the buildings which surround the Grand
Place.</p>

<p>He told us, with great humour, a laughable incident which had
occurred to him at Antwerp. The morning after his arrival at that
city from Holland, he started at an early hour to visit the tomb of
Rubens in the Church of St. Jacques, before his party were up.
Having provided himself with a map of the city, he had no other
guide; but after wandering about for an hour, without finding the
object he had in view, he determined to make inquiry, and observing
a person stalking about like himself, he addressed him, in his best
French; but the stranger pulling off his hat, very respectfully
replied, in the pure Highland accent, "I'm vary sorry, Sir, but I
canna speak ony thing besides <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page112" id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span> English."&mdash;"This is
very unlucky indeed, Donald," said Mr. Scott, "but we must help one
another; for, to tell you the truth, I'm not good at any other
tongue but the English, or rather, the Scotch."&mdash;"Oh, Sir,
maybe," replied the Highlander, "you are a countryman, and ken my
maister, Captain Cameron, of the 79th, and could tell me where he
lodges. I'm just cum in, Sir, frae a place they ca' <i>Machlin</i>,
and ha forgotten the name of the captain's quarters; it was
something like the <i>Laaborer</i>."&mdash;"I can, I think, help
you with this, my friend," rejoined Mr. Scott. "There is an inn
just opposite to you, (pointing to the <i>Hotel de Grand
Laboreur</i>,) I dare say that will be the captain's quarters;" and
so it was. I cannot do justice to the humour in which Mr. Scott
recounted this dialogue.</p>

cleaned his hands with his tongue, excepting the emperor, who wiped
the hand he took his meat up with on the head of a black boy, ten
years old, who stood by his side. The ambassador smiled, and the
emperor observing it, asked what Christian kings wiped their hands
with at meals, and what such things were worth? "Fine napkins,"
replied the ambassador, "a clean one at every meal, worth a crown a
piece or more." "Don't you think this napkin much better," said the
emperor, wiping his hand again on the black boy's head, "which is
worth seventy or eighty crowns."</p>

the managers &pound;200. more, for all the performances. For the
last play, the actors received &pound;100. One of the plays acted
here was Shakspeare's Henry VIII&mdash;thus making the palace the
scene of Wolseys downfall, as it had been of his splendour.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
